# TypeScript Generics Tutorial

## Things to add

1. Default generics
1. Generic constraints
1. Using default generics to compute variables
1. F.Narrow
1. Multiple generics
1. When to use any in highly dynamic generic signatures
1. Spotting useless generics
1. Generics in template literal types
1. Inferring number/boolean from template literal types
1. Infer
1. Generics in type predicates and assertion functions
1. Using function overloads to specify different generic signatures
1. Generics in object primitive types
1. Generics in classes
1. this is this & {}
1. Multiple generics per object

## Things NOT to add

These things are out-of-scope, or will be included in other modules

- What are function overloads?
- Converting union types to object types to make them faster (via key mapping and Extract)

<!-- - limits of typeof narrowing (unknown and object)
- Type predicates
- Using external libraries and @types
- discriminated unions
  - narrowing on discriminated unions
- Template literals
- Branded types
- Readonly properties on objects
- Index signatures
- `keyof`
- Readonly, Exclude, Extract (union-based or readonly-based utility types)
- let vs const vs as const
- Function overloads
- typeof
- Generics in functions -->
